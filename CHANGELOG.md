# Changelog

## Unreleased — 2026-07-09

### Changed: `kotoba.gpu` is now a thin re-export of `kami.gpu` (kotoba-lang/webgpu)

**Why.** Like `kotoba-lang/sprite-gpu` and `kotoba-lang/webgl`, this repo's `kotoba.gpu` traces back
to the same abandoned 2026-07-02 "clj-wgsl Phase-4" split-migration as `kotoba-lang/webgpu`'s
internal `src/kami/gpu.cljc`, and the two copies diverged silently after independent "restore"
commits.

Diffing the two (normalizing `kotoba.*` → `kami.*`) found **no functional bug** on either side —
every `def`/`defn` body is byte-identical. The diff is entirely in docstrings: `kami.gpu` documents
native WebGPU (`+ native (wgpu)`) and native Metal/Vulkan/DX12 targets (`native via wgpu + naga`)
that this repo's copy's docstring doesn't mention, reflecting `kotoba-lang/webgpu`'s more current
commit (`2b96271`, "capability-gated render-graph contract — one EDN, every GPU backend"). This
repo's own git history has no commits between its restore and CI/lint housekeeping — all real
development happened in `kotoba-lang/webgpu`.

Consumer evidence: `network-isekai`, `net-babiniku`, and every other live production consumer
depend on `kotoba-lang/webgpu` (i.e. `kami.gpu`), not this repo. This repo's only confirmed
consumers were other `kotoba-lang` scaffolding repos (`webgl`), which is being repointed to
`kotoba-lang/webgpu` directly in the same consolidation pass.

**What changed.**
- `deps.edn`: added `io.github.kotoba-lang/webgpu {:local/root "../webgpu"}`.
- `src/kotoba/gpu.cljc`: replaced the duplicated implementation with a thin re-export of
  `kami.gpu` — same public API (`caps-webgpu`, `caps-native`, `caps-console`, `caps-webgl2`,
  `tiers`, `missing-caps`, `pass-runnable?`, `resolve-graph`, `resolve-for`, `caps-from-device`,
  `requires`), so anything still requiring `kotoba.gpu` keeps working unmodified, but it can never
  drift from the canonical copy again.

This repo itself is **not** being archived or deleted — that's a separate decision, out of scope
here. It remains usable standalone; it just no longer maintains a second copy of the logic.
